# Map Tile Downloader

The Map Tile Downloader is a Flask-based web application designed to download map tiles from various sources. It allows users to select specific areas on a map, choose zoom levels, and download tiles for offline use. The application supports converting tiles to 8-bit color depth for compatibility with Meshtastic® UI Maps and provides options to view and manage cached tiles.

- **World Basemap Downloads**: Download tiles for the entire world at zoom levels 0-7.
- **8-bit Conversion**: Option to convert downloaded tiles to 8-bit color depth for Meshtastic® UI Maps.
- **Cache Management**: View and delete cached tiles for different map styles.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar showing downloaded, skipped, and failed tiles.
- **Configurable Map Sources**: Easily add or modify map sources via a JSON configuration file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher (For Windows, make sure that Python in installed with the ADD TO PATH option selected)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository (or download the zip file and extract to the location of your choice):
   
	git clone https://github.com/yourusername/map-tile-downloader.git
	cd map-tile-downloader
   
2. Install Dependencies (Optional) :
    	The application will automatically install required dependencies from requirements.txt on startup. However, you can manually install them using:

		pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up Configuration (Optional, default sources are included) :

   Ensure the config/map_sources.json file is present and correctly formatted. See the Configuration section below for an example.
   
   
## Configuration
The application uses a JSON configuration file (config/map_sources.json) to define available map sources. Each entry consists of a name and a URL template for the tiles.

Example map_sources.json:
	
		"OpenStreetMap": "https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
		"OpenTopoMap": "https://{s}.tile.opentopomap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
		"Stamen Terrain": "http://{s}.tile.stamen.com/terrain/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
		"CartoDB Positron": "https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
		"CartoDB Dark Matter": "https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/dark_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
	

Adding a New Map Source: Simply add a new key-value pair to the JSON file with the map name and its tile URL template.


## Usage
1.	Navigate to the application directory and Run the Application:

		python src/TileDL.py
	
	The application will start a local server at http://localhost:5000.
	- Alternatively you may create a Batch file "StartMap.bat" to launch from windows:
 - 		@echo off
		cd /d C:\(extractlocation)\map-tile-downloader
		python scr/TileDL.py
		pause

3. 	Access the Web Interface:

	Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
		
4. 	Select Map Style:

	Choose a map style from the dropdown menu. The available options are loaded from map_sources.json.
5. 	Draw Polygons:
	
	Use the drawing tools to select areas on the map for which you want to download tiles.
		
6.	Set Zoom Levels:
	
	Specify the minimum and maximum zoom levels for the tiles you wish to download.

7.	Download Tiles:

	Click "Download Tiles" to start downloading tiles for the selected areas and zoom levels.
	Alternatively, click "Download World Basemap" to download tiles for the entire world at zoom levels 0-7.

8.	Monitor Progress:

	The progress bar will display the number of downloaded, skipped, and failed tiles.

9.	Manage Cache:

	Check "View cached tiles" to see outlines of cached tiles on the map.
